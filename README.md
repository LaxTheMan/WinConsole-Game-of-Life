# WinConsole-Game-of-Life

Windows Console based application simulating John Conway's Game of Life.

## Compilation
To compile the program with `g++` (mingw64), use the following command:

```g++ -o game_of_life game_of_life.cpp```

## Instructions
Use the arrow keys to move around the grid.

Press 'r' to randomize the initial state of cells.

While moving (using arrow keys), hold down 'q' to invert the state of cells.

Press the spacebar to play the simulation.

It is recommended to run the executable as an administrator to avoid compatibility and size/font issues.
